- The code is very slow when solving in parallel with more then 2 processors. Expensive communication.

- you can write only one solver (parallel) and adapt it to the case of only one processor
- the computational time for the sequential solver should be the same with every number of processors, since it works only on one.
- scalability test gets stuck with more than 4 processes.

- no openmp
